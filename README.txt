MQEQ Map Editor is a work in progress map editor for the game "The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap" for gba.

The file "lz77.py" has been straight taken from the project blues-pider by cosarara97
(https://github.com/cosarara97/blue-spider), which I have forked. The code in this file
is a port to python of some functions from NLZ-Advance, by Nintenlord.
Big thanks to both.

Dependencies:
- Python 3
- Sip
- PyQt5
- Pillow (just PIL may work, haven't tested it myself)
